# TextMeApp
Hello, this is my university course project. My task was to make client - server app, because of that I made messanger and call him TextMe. 
All client side was made with JavaFx, server side using only Java Core and JDBC to work with PostgreSQL database. Also server side use Log4J 2 to data logging.
Connection between server and client was made using WebSockets.
It is very simple messanger with registration, authorization and form, where you can send and receive only text messages.

Start form:
